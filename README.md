# Infiswift
This program launches with ViewController which shows two options 

(1) Sequence - when pressed the it shows the SequenceViewController which takes only valid input from user to build a sequence. User have to enter positive number in the textfield and press submit.
Then user needs to press find to find the first or smallest missing number of the sequence entered by the user. The result and the progress gets displayed at the simulator screen
User can clear everything by pressing a button in top right corner and can repeat the process

(2) Circular - a queue with a loop is already created in the program and the screen displays the queue (without loop) and the result.
If you want to edit queue then you need to change the code and run again.
